# Changelog

All notable changes to `research-scope-mcp`. Each version bump is one immutable
registry publish version (official MCP registry rule: versions are unique per publish;
metadata is immutable, so fix errors by publishing a *new* version).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-10-15

### Added
- `plan_research(scope)` — source-target plan with kill criteria.
- `fetch_and_score(source_url)` — explainable source-quality scoring
  (primary-source detection, freshness, paywall + COI flags; HTTP status gate).
- `build_report(topic, sources)` — citation-registry report shell saved under
  `data/reports/`; unscored sources are rejected with an error naming them.
- `check_report(report_id | report_path)` — every substantive claim must cite ≥1
  scored source; orphan claims return an error list, never a pass.
- Dual transport: stdio (default) + Streamable HTTP (`--http --port N`).
- Docker build ([docker/Dockerfile](docker/Dockerfile)) for Glamal/Docker-Catalog
  reproducible-build scans.
- Client configs: Claude Code, Cursor, Cline (`clients/llms-install.md`).

### Notes
- Scoring rubric v1 weights (availability 20 / primary 32 / freshness 24 / access 12 /
  independence 12) documented in README and returned with evidence per dimension.
